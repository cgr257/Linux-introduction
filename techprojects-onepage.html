<h1 class="western">Welcome to TechProjects!</h1>
<div id="content" dir="ltr">
	<p>This site is for people with a do-it-yourself attitude and some
	extra time and hardware. If you have an old computer laying around,
	don't let it go to waste! There are plenty of projects you can do to
	re-purpose old hardware that are simultaneously, fun, educational
	and practical.</p>
	<p>Learning a little bit about how computers work will take you a
	long way. We live in an increasingly technology reliant world, and I
	find it disappointing that so many people spend so much time using
	devices that they don't fully understand. So often we just want the
	newest and best tech toys, but we frequently fail to recognize that
	computers are tools, and when we use them, we generally have a
	specific purpose in mind - it is always a good idea to have a better
	understanding of how to accomplish your goals, and goals that we aim
	to achieve through the use of technology are no exception.</p>
	<p>If you have ever been curious about how something works; if
	you've ever wondered what lies at the heart of the technology you
	use every day; if you've ever thought to yourself: &quot;I bet I
	could make something that does that!&quot; then you are the kind of
	person that needs a project! Look around, see if you can find some
	ideas for a place to start your own project. Keep in mind, I made
	this site for a school assignment, so it isn't the best source of
	information if you have a genuine desire to learn (I tried to
	include links to relevant resources where possible) but what I have
	posted here comes from my own unique experience with technology
	based projects, and it is therefore new information that someone
	could potentially benefit from. Hopefully you can find something
	here that leads you down a road you might not have otherwise
	traveled.</p>
	<p>Alright! let's get started on some new projects! 
	</p>
</div>
<h1 class="western">Projects</h1>
<p>There are several categories of projects on this site. All are
things that I have spent some time learning, but I am no expert in
any of it. This is meant to be a way to get some ideas of things to
do on your own. I encourage you to look things up on your own,
experiment, and do whatever works best for you, but above all: RTFM
and don't do anything to your computer or run any code if you don't
know what it'll do. You are responsible for your own actions.</p>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<h3 class="western">Linux Projects</h3>
<p>Many of the projects here make use of Free/Libre/Open Source
Software (FLOSS). Being able to use a GNU/Linux distribution makes
these sorts of projects much easier. A big reason that it's good to
use GNU/Linux is becuause it's free in two ways- free as in &quot;free
speech&quot; (libre) and free as in &quot;free beer&quot; (gratis).
Both of these things are good for a do-it-yourselfer. If you're
looking into starting a project that you're not very confident about,
it would be difficult to put down a few hundred dollars on software -
that's why it's great to have an operating system that comes at no
monetary cost. If you want to do something that contributes to your
own personal or professional growth, I think its best to stick to
something that was created with the free sharing of information in
mind - that's why it's great to have an operating system that comes
with no heavy handed licensing requirements and that allows you to
modify it at will.</p>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<h3 class="western">LAMP projects</h3>
<p>In this section we will look at very basic uses for a common
server solution stack that uses Linux, Apache, MySQL, Python and PHP
(LAMP servers).</p>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<h3 class="western">Networking Projects</h3>
<p>Most people have a home network (LAN), but few people use it to
its full potential. Here we'll discuss several projects you can do on
your own network that will help you to realize the true potential of
your networked computers.</p>
<h1 class="western">Linux Projects</h1>
<p><br/>
<img src="techprojects-onepage_html_6f29d8df0853648e.jpg" name="Image1" alt="Tux - The Linux Mascot" align="bottom" width="252" height="300" border="0"/>

</p>
<p>If you've never used linux before, and you'd like to try it, you
have a few options. The first is to install it on an old computer
that you don't mind tinkering with. Another option is to install it
to a virtual machine like virtualbox so that you don't have to
acually run the risk of reinstalling the OS on any of your real
hardware.</p>
<p>Once you have decided where you would like to install Linux, you
have to decide which distribution to go with. Unlike Microsoft
Windows and Mac OS, Linux is open source, meaning that anyone with
the skill and desire can modify, add to, personalize, and
redistribute it. Because of this, there are lots of different flavors
of Linux called &quot;Distributions&quot; or &quot;Distros.&quot; You
can find a pretty comprehensive list of the most popular Linux
Distros at Distrowatch.com.</p>
<p>For someone who has never used Linux before, I would recommend
something like Linux Mint or Ubuntu</p>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<h3 class="western">Linux Project #1 - Basic Bash Commands</h3>
<p>This project is an introduction to working with the command line
interface (CLI) in linux. The command line is the most basic way of
telling the computer what to do (issuing commands). Being comfortable
on the command line is a must for anyone who wants to get the most
out of linux, though with the current crop of distributions like Mint
and Ubuntu, it isn't strictly necessary anymore. There is a lot of
debate in the Linux world over whether or not this is a good thing.</p>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<h3 class="western">Linux Project #2 - Installing and Uninstalling
Software on Debian Based Distributions</h3>
<p>Under Windows, most people are used to going to the store,
purchasing software, then coming home to install it with a CD or DVD.
Linux works very differently when it comes to software. Because most
software you will encounter in Linux is free or open source, you can
simply take your pick of software and download it for free. There is
no need to purchase or pirate bloated and restrictive proprietary
software - everything you need is available for free.</p>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<h3 class="western">Linux Project #3 - Sed and wget</h3>
<p>Since we're using the command line, let's take a look at some
really useful command line tools which we'll use again in a later
project.</p>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<h3 class="western">Linux Project #4 - Bash Scripting</h3>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p>Once you know what you want to do on the command line, it's not
that much more work to make it into a script. A script is series of
commands that you could have entered individually on the command
line, but instead saved in a single file that can be run like a
program. Learning how to do this to automate basic tasks is a huge
time saver.</p>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<h3 class="western">Linux Project #5 - Adding a Bash Script to Cron</h3>
<p>If you have a script that you want to run on a regular basis, the
best thing to do is to make it a &quot;Cron Job&quot; - Linux lingo
that means add it to a list of scripts that run regularly with
instructions on when to run it.</p>
<h1 class="western">Linux Project #1 - Basic Bash Commands</h1>
<p>Fire up your Linux terminal emulator of choice and let's get
started! If you're running Mint or Ubuntu you can do this in several
ways - look through your applications menu until you see something
called &quot;Terminal.&quot; Alternatively you can just type Alt+f2
then enter &quot;gnome-terminal&quot;</p>
<p>below we'll look at some of the basic commands you'll need to know
to become a command line guru.</p>
<p><br/>
<br/>
<br/>

</p>
<h3 class="western">pwd</h3>
<p>When you have your terminal emulator running, all you'll see is a
prompt that probably looks something like:</p>
<pre class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in">username@computer ~ $</pre><p>
If you hit enter, it'll just drop to a new line and say the same
thing again. What you're looking at is an interface to issue commands
to your computer directly. The first command you'll learn is &quot;pwd&quot;
which means &quot;print working directory.&quot; When you type pwd at
this prompt, it will return the directory you're currently in.</p>
<pre class="western">username@computer ~ $ pwd
/home/username
username@computer ~ $</pre><p>
<br/>
<br/>

</p>
<h3 class="western">ls</h3>
<p>You can't do much just sitting in a directory, so we're going to
issue another command: &quot;ls&quot;. This command lists the
directory contents.</p>
<pre class="western">username@computer ~ $ ls
Desktop Documents Downloads Music Pictures Public Templates Videos
username@computer ~ $</pre><p>
your results may vary depending on what you've got in your home
directory.</p>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<h3 class="western">mkdir</h3>
<p>We're going to create a directory to work in for the rest of this
project. Run the command &quot;mkdir techprojects&quot;</p>
<pre class="western">username@computer ~ $ mkdir techprojects
username@computer ~ $</pre><p>
It looks like nothing happened, but when you run &quot;ls&quot;
again, you see what changed.</p>
<pre class="western">username@computer ~ $ ls
Desktop Documents Downloads Music Pictures Public techprojects Templates Videos
username@computer ~ $</pre><p>
we now have a directory to work in. We're left with a problem though:
we're not in the right directory.</p>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<h3 class="western">cd</h3>
<p>The &quot;cd&quot; command allows you to change directories. We're
going to cd into the techprojects directory we just created.</p>
<pre class="western">username@computer ~ $ cd techprojects
username@computer ~/techprojects $</pre><p>
My prompt changed when I did that (see the &quot;/techprojects&quot;
between the &quot;~&quot; and &quot;$&quot;?). Yours might not
change, but if you want to check where you are, you can always run
&quot;pwd&quot; again. 
</p>
<pre class="western">username@computer ~/techprojects $ pwd
/home/username/techprojects
username@computer ~/techprojects $</pre><p>
Let's change back up to the directory we were just in for a moment.
There are a few ways to do this, so we'll talk about them one by one.
Since we're going up one directory we can type &quot;cd ..&quot; 
</p>
<pre class="western">username@computer ~/techprojects $ cd ..
username@computer ~ $ pwd
/home/username
username@computer ~ $</pre><p>
the first time we switched to the techprojects directory, we were
able to get away with just typing the name of the directory and not
its full location, because it was in our working directory. You can't
always do that. Go ahead and cd to the next highest directory by
running &quot;cd ..&quot; again, then try to cd into the techprojects
directory by running &quot;cd techprojects&quot;</p>
<pre class="western">username@computer ~ $ cd ..
username@computer /home $ pwd
/home
username@computer /home $ cd techprojects
bash: cd: techprojects: No such file or directory
username@computer /home $</pre><p>
we can't use the same shortcut since the techprojects directory isn't
in our working directory any more. We have to specify what's called
an &quot;absolute path&quot; to the directory we want. We want to go
to &quot;/home/username/techprojects&quot; so that's what we'll tell
cd:</p>
<pre class="western">username@computer /home $ cd /home/username/techprojects
username@computer ~/techprojects $ pwd
/home/username/techprojects
username@computer ~/techprojects $</pre><p>
<br/>
<br/>

</p>
<h3 class="western">man</h3>
<p>The user manual for linux is built right in. If at any time you
forget what a command does, you can look up the manual for by typing
&quot;man&quot; followed by the command you're looking for more
information about. Try running &quot;man ls&quot; or &quot;man pwd&quot;.
When you're done looking at the manual, type &quot;q&quot; to quit.</p>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<h3 class="western">clear</h3>
<p>We've been running lots of commands, and our terminal window has a
long history of everything we've just done. Sometimes this can be
distracting, so you can get rid of all the old commands still in the
terminal window by typing &quot;clear&quot;</p>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<h3 class="western">date</h3>
<p>There are some pretty useful functions built in to Linux. One is
&quot;date&quot; which will print the current date and time. If you
spend a few minutes reading the man page for date, you'll find that
you can print more specific parts of the date by adding extra
arguments. Try &quot;date +%F&quot; or &quot;date +%r&quot; as some
examples.</p>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<h3 class="western">cal</h3>
<p>While we're on the subject of the date and time I should mention
that Linux has a built in calendar. Too see it type &quot;cal&quot;</p>
<h3 class="western">echo</h3>
<p>You can make the terminal say anything you want by typing &quot;echo&quot;
followed by whatever you want it to say.</p>
<pre class="western">username@computer ~/techprojects $ echo &quot;hello world&quot;
hello world
username@computer ~/techprojects $</pre><h3 class="western">
variables</h3>
<p>Just like in algebra, sometimes we need to use variables on the
command line. You can assign variables just by using the equals sign
like so: &quot;x=5&quot;. make sure you dont leave any space between
your variable, the equals sign, and the value. You can combine
variables with echo to print the value of any assigned variable.</p>
<pre class="western">username@computer ~/techprojects $ x=5
username@computer ~/techprojects $ echo $x
5
username@computer ~/techprojects $</pre><p>
Note that when calling a variable (unlike assigning it) you must
preface it with &quot;$&quot;. If you'd like to, you can make the
output of a command a variable.</p>
<pre class="western">username@computer ~/techprojects $ today=$(date +%F)
username@computer ~/techprojects $ echo $today
2012-03-04
username@computer ~/techprojects $</pre><p>
When I assigned the output of the date command to the variable
&quot;today&quot; in the above command I had to format it
appropriately so that Bash would know that I mean the output of the
command rather than the words themselves. You can either do it the
way I did it above, or enclose the command in backticks the key to
the left of &quot;1&quot;</p>
<pre class="western">username@computer ~/techprojects $ now=`date +%r`
username@computer ~/techprojects $ echo $now
11:02:38 AM
username@computer ~/techprojects $</pre><p>
<br/>
<br/>

</p>
<h3 class="western">Redirecting Output with &quot;&gt;&quot;, &quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;,
and &quot;|&quot;</h3>
<p>If you want to take the output of a command and save it to a file,
you can just type &quot;[command] &gt; filename&quot;</p>
<pre class="western">username@computer ~/techprojects $ date &gt; today.txt
username@computer ~/techprojects $ ls
today.txt
username@computer ~/techprojects $</pre><p>
Using &quot;&gt;&quot; will overwrite the contents of any file you
redirect the output to, so be careful. You can use &quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;
to add to the end of a file that already exists rather than
overwriting it.</p>
<pre class="western">username@computer ~/techprojects $ echo &quot;Fred&quot; &gt; bedrock.txt
username@computer ~/techprojects $ echo &quot;Wilma&quot; &gt;&gt; bedrock.txt
username@computer ~/techprojects $ echo &quot;Dino&quot; &gt;&gt; bedrock.txt
username@computer ~/techprojects $</pre><p>
If you need to send the output of one command or program into another
command or program instead of a file, you can use a pipe &quot;|&quot;
(shares a key with &quot;\&quot;). We'll come back to this later.</p>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<h3 class="western">cat</h3>
<p>cat prints the contents of a file. We can use it to check that
what we just did actually worked.</p>
<pre class="western">username@computer ~/techprojects $ cat today.txt
Sun Mar  4 11:15:47 EST 2012
username@computer ~/techprojects $ cat bedrock.txt
Fred
Wilma
Dino
username@computer ~/techprojects $</pre><p>
<br/>
<br/>

</p>
<h3 class="western">grep</h3>
<p>grep searches for a user specified string in a user specified
location like a file or the output of a command</p>
<pre class="western">username@computer ~/techprojects $ grep Betty bedrock.txt
username@computer ~/techprojects $ </pre><p>
This command returns nothing because &quot;Betty&quot; is not in the
file bedrock.txt</p>
<pre class="western">username@computer ~/techprojects $ grep Wilma bedrock.txt
Wilma
username@computer ~/techprojects $ </pre><p>
This command returns &quot;Wilma&quot; because &quot;Wilma&quot; is
in the file bedrock.txt. grep is also used very frequently in
conjunction with pipes. we can pipe the output of the command date to
Grep to search it for a specific string.</p>
<pre class="western">username@computer ~/techprojects $ date | grep Sun
<b>Sun</b> Mar  4 11:43:03 EST 2012
username@computer ~/techprojects $ </pre><p>
&quot;Sun&quot; is bold, and in my terminal it is also red. Grep then
prints the rest of the line where it found the search term. You might
think that this isn't very useful since it's very easy to find the
search string manually with the output of the date command. This is
true, but when looking for something within much larger output it can
be very useful. look at the amount of output of the command: &quot;ps
-e&quot;. This is a list of every process currently running on your
machine. You could run &quot;ps -e | grep firefox&quot; to see if
firefox is running. 
</p>
<h3 class="western">cp</h3>
<p>cp copies a file.</p>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<pre class="western">username@computer ~/techprojects $ cp bedrock.txt fredshouse.txt
username@computer ~/techprojects $ ls
bedrock.txt  fredshouse.txt  today.txt
username@computer ~/techprojects $ </pre><p>
<br/>
<br/>

</p>
<h3 class="western">rm</h3>
<p>rm removes (deletes) a file.</p>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<pre class="western">username@computer ~/techprojects $ rm bedrock.txt
username@computer ~/techprojects $ ls
fredshouse.txt  today.txt
username@computer ~/techprojects $ </pre><p>
<br/>
<br/>

</p>
<h3 class="western">mv</h3>
<p>mv moves a file to a new location or it changes its name. It's the
same as using cp to create a new file then rm to remove the old one.</p>
<pre class="western">username@computer ~/techprojects $ mv today.txt yesterday.txt
username@computer ~/techprojects $ ls
fredshouse.txt  yesterday.txt
username@computer ~/techprojects $ </pre><p>
<br/>
<br/>

</p>
<h3 class="western">exit</h3>
<p>when you're ready to close your terminal you can type &quot;exit&quot;</p>
<h1 class="western">Linux Project #2 - Installing and uninstalling
software</h1>
<p>in order to install software you need root access to the machine
you're working on. If you're the one who installed your operating
system, and you're running Mint or Ubuntu, all you need is your
regular account password. If you're using Debian, Fedora, Slackware,
or some other distro the process is slightly more complicated, and
I'm not going to get into it here. If you're in this situation google
&quot;sudoers file.&quot;</p>
<p>If you're unfamiliar with the way linux manages software packages
in repositories, or your distros particular package management
system, you need to do some reading</p>
<p>I'm using a Debian based Distro that uses apt-get, so that's what
we're going to use here. to install a package with apt-get when you
know the name of the package, all you have to do is type &quot;sudo
apt-get install [package name]&quot;. let's do that with a package
that we'll need for a later project.</p>
<pre class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in">sudo apt-get install wget</pre><p>
after you type the above in a terminal, you should see lots of text
scroll down the screen. When it stops, your program is installed.</p>
<h1 class="western">Linux Project #3 - Sed and Wget</h1>
<p>This project uses two popular and powerful Linux programs, sed and
wget. Wget downloads files (and much more) from the internet, and
provides lots of options for how to get them. Sed (<b>s</b>tream
<b>ed</b>itor) looks at text passed to it and modifies it based on
user spefified rules. It's a good idea to read the man pages for both
programs before starting.</p>
<h3 class="western">wget</h3>
<p>let's start with a very basic use for wget: downloading a single
file. You can download the html page you're looking at right now by
running:</p>
<pre class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in">wget http://coldfusion.allegany.edu/smith191/grimsley/linux/03-tools.htm</pre><p>
as you can see, all that is required is the location of a file passed
as an argument and wget will download the specified file to the
working directory. Alternatively, if you had several files you wanted
to download, you could add them to the file wgeturls.txt then type:</p>
<pre class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in">wget -i wgeturls.txt</pre><p>
There are a lot of other cools things you can do with wget, like the
-k and -r arguments (read the man page), but we're going to use it in
a pretty simple way today, so we don't need to get into all that. On
to sed! 
</p>
<h3 class="western">sed</h3>
<p>sed is an old program (it was written in the early 70's for Unix)
but it's still one of the most useful utilities you can find in Linux
and other Unix-like operating systems. Sed can do some pretty cool
stuff, like replace every instance of a certain word in a file:</p>
<pre class="western">username@computer ~/techprojects $ echo &quot;You want a toe? I can get you a toe.&quot; &gt; dude.txt
username@computer ~/techprojects $ cat dude.txt
You want a toe? I can get you a toe.
username@computer ~/techprojects $ sed -e 's/toe/cat/g' dude.txt &gt; reddit.txt
username@computer ~/techprojects $ cat reddit.txt
You want a cat? I can get you a cat.</pre><p>
You can also print everything between two words:</p>
<pre class="western">username@computer ~/techprojects $ echo -e &quot;Dude \nMaude \nWalter \nDonny \nStranger&quot; &gt; big.txt
username@computer ~/techprojects $ cat big.txt
Dude 
Maude 
Walter 
Donny 
Stranger
username@computer ~/techprojects $ sed -n '/Maude/,/Donny/p' big.txt
Maude 
Walter 
Donny
username@computer ~/techprojects $</pre><h3 class="western">
The Project</h3>
<p>What I'd like to do is combine wget and sed to download the
opinion page from my local newspaper, strip away all the excess code
from the HTML file, and print a list of urls that link to the current
letters to the editor hosted on the newspaper's website. The first
thing to do is download the opinion page html file with wget. cd to a
directory you'd like to work in and then run this command:</p>
<pre class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in">wget http://times-news.com/opinion/index.html</pre><p>
If you cat that file, you'll see that it's mostly excess html sitting
around very few lines that we actually want. What we need to do is
find something in the file that indicates the beginning and end of
the section we're interested in, and luckily this is easy to do with
html. The links we want are in a div called &quot;headline_list&quot;
so we're going to use sed to print just the lines between where that
div starts, and its end tag. The div starts with '&lt;dl
id=&quot;headline_list&quot;&gt;' and ends with '&lt;/dl&gt;'. Since
&quot;/&quot; is a delimiter, we'll have to escape it with &quot;\&quot;</p>
<pre class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in">sed -n '/&lt;dl id=&quot;headline_list&quot;&gt;/,/&lt;\/dl&gt;/p' index.html &gt; $(date +%F).opinionsection.html</pre><p>
This will create a new file named [yyyy-mm-dd].opinionsection.html
which contains only the part of the file we are interested in, but
it's still a lot of HTML, and it's way more than just links to
articles. We'll use grep to find just the links. We do this by
grepping for &quot;&lt;a href=&quot; in the file we created in the
last command, which will print all lines that start with that tag,
then we redirect the output to a new file.</p>
<pre class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in">grep '&lt;a href=' $(date +%F).opinionsection.html &gt; $(date +%F).opinionlinks.html</pre><p>
Next we'll get rid of whatever html is still embedded in the links
and leave behind the URLs only</p>
<pre class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in">sed -i -r 's/.*&lt;a href=\&quot;(.*)\&quot;.*/\1/' $(date +%F).opinionlinks.html</pre><p>
because of the way this newspaper formats the opinion page the first
url repeats itself, so we should remove that line. We'll take care of
this by removing any duplicate lines with &quot;uniq&quot;</p>
<pre class="western">uniq $(date +%F).opinionlinks.html &gt; $(date +%F).opinionlinks.temp.html
mv $(date +%F).opinionlinks.temp.html $(date +%F).opinionlinks.html</pre><p>
There's a similar problem with the last line (it points to a second
page with more headlines, which we're not interested in at all) so
we'll take that off too.</p>
<pre class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in">sed -i -e '$d' $(date +%F).opinionlinks.html</pre><p>
finally we'll clean up a little bit, and since the file we were
working on no longer contains links or any html, we'll rename it to
something appropriate. 
</p>

mv $(date +%F).opinionlinks.html $(date +%F).opinionurls.txt</pre><p>
We're left with just one file named [yyyy-mm-dd].opinionurls.txt and
it contains exactly what we were looking for.&lt;/project&gt;</p>
<h1 class="western">Linux Project #4 - Bash Scripting</h1>
<p>Our last project was great, but it took a lot of effort, and if
it's the kind of thing that you plan on doing daily, it's not worth
doing unless it's automatic. That's what computers are for, right?
Let's take all of the commands from the last project, and just throw
them into a text file, one to a line. That file would look like this:</p>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<pre class="western">wget http://times-news.com/opinion/index.html
sed -n '/&lt;dl id=&quot;headline_list&quot;&gt;/,/&lt;\/dl&gt;/p' index.html &gt; $(date +%F).opinionsection.html
grep '&lt;a href=' $(date +%F).opinionsection.html &gt; $(date +%F).opinionlinks.html
sed -i -r 's/.*&lt;a href=\&quot;(.*)\&quot;.*/\1/' $(date +%F).opinionlinks.html
uniq $(date +%F).opinionlinks.html &gt; $(date +%F).opinionlinks.temp.html
mv $(date +%F).opinionlinks.temp.html $(date +%F).opinionlinks.html
sed -i -e '$d' $(date +%F).opinionlinks.html
rm index.html
rm $(date +%F).opinionsection.html
mv $(date +%F).opinionlinks.html $(date +%F).opinionurls.txt</pre><p>
<br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p>This is actually almost a script. We need to do a few things
though. First we need to add a line to the top that tells the
computer how to run the script. We wrote this in bash, so we need to
point to the bash binary. You can find it by typing &quot;whereis
bash&quot; but I'll save you the time and tell you that if you're
running linux, it's almost certainly in &quot;/bin/bash&quot;. We'll
add this to the top of the file after a shebang or hashbang (#!).</p>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<pre class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in">#!/bin/bash</pre><p>
<br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p>One other thing we might need to add is a line that makes sure the
script creates the files in the right directory. The first 6 lines in
the modified script that follows are an &quot;if condition&quot;. If
there is a folder called &quot;opinionget&quot; in the home directory
of the user running the script, it cds to it. If there isn't it makes
one, then cds to it. Either way, everything else that happens is done
in that directory.</p>
<p><br/>
<br/>

        cd /home/$(whoami)/opinionget

Linux Project #5 - Adding a Bash Script to Cron</h1>
<p>The last project created a script, but in order to get the daily
opinion page urls, we would still have to run the script manually
every day. While this is way better than running each command
individually every day, it's still not quite what we're looking for.
The last step is to make the script a &quot;cron job&quot; i.e. add
it to a list of scripts to run regularly. If you haven't done so
already, go ahead and read the man page for crontab. Once you have an
idea of what crontab is, go ahead and run</p>
<pre class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in">&quot;crontab -l&quot;</pre><p>
if you have anything in your crontab already you'll see it here. You
can also see that when adding scripts, it is done in the following
format:</p>
<pre class="western">*    *    *    *    *   /path/to/script
T    T    T    T    T
|    |    |    |    |
|    |    |    |    |
|    |    |    |    `----- day of week (0 - 6) (0 is Sunday, or use names)
|    |    |    `---------- month (1 - 12)
|    |    `---------------- day of month (1 - 31)
|    `-------------------- hour (0 - 23)
`------------------------- min (0 - 59)</pre><p>
<br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p>some examples:</p>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<pre class="western">Run at 11AM Monday - Friday:
0 11 * * 1-5 /some/script

Run at 5:30PM on the 15th of the month, every month:
30 17 15 * * /another/script

Run every day at 4AM:
0 4 * * * /yet/another/script

</pre><p>
The script we wrote in the last project should be run daily, as the
newspaper updates its page daily. We should put it somewhere like
/home/$(whoami)/bin/ so that we know its important (and if you want
to you can add that directory to your path). Let's edit crontab.</p>
<pre class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in">crontab -e</pre><p>
add the following to the end of the file:</p>
<pre class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in">0 4 * * * /home/[your-user-name]/bin/opinionget.sh</pre><p>
If later you want to remove it, run &quot;crontab -e&quot; again and
delete or comment out the line you just added. That's it. Every day
you can look in the folder &quot;getopinion&quot; in your home
directory to see a list of URLs to opinion articles from the
Cumberland Times News... Get ready to rage.</p>
<p>Later we'll take this data and turn it into something a little
more useful.</p>

<h3 class="western">LAMP Project #1 - Install and Configure Apache
Web Server</h3>
<p>We have already taken care of the first element of our LAMP server
when we installed Linux during our first series of projects. Now
we'll take care of the second element by installing Apache 2</p>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<h3 class="western">LAMP Project #2 - Install and configure Webmin</h3>
<p>Managing a server is difficult if you've never done it, and
working strictly on the command line, though it is a suitable
end-goal, is difficult to manage for those just getting started.
Webmin provides a web interface for performing many tasks that would
otherwise require extensive knowledge of the command line.</p>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<h3 class="western">LAMP Project #3 - Install and Configure
PHPMyAdmin</h3>
<p>As in the last step, we can save ourselves a lot of command line
hacking by installing a suitable web interface. In this instance,
we're tackling the &quot;M&quot; in LAMP server - MySQL. Learning
MySQL commands can be very difficult for beginners, so we're going to
use PHPmyAdmin, which is much more intuitive, and easier to learn,
which will allow you to spend more time coding and less time kicking
yourself for accidentally issuing DROP TABLE incorrectly. To be
clear: PHPMyAdmin won't keep you from screwing up MySQL, but it does
make it easier not to. 
</p>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<h3 class="western">LAMP Project #4 - Python</h3>
<p>The last element of our LAMP server is Python/PHP (no insult to
Perl intended! maybe some other time). We'll break it into two parts.
In this first part, we'll write a python script that adds data
generated by the bash script in the Linux section to a table in the
MySQL database we created in LAMP project #3</p>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<h3 class="western">LAMP Project #5 - PHP</h3>
<p>The second half of the previous project will use PHP to read the
data that we just entered into our databse. If time permits, we'll
lament the lack of a working PHP installation on the server that
hosts ACM web development projects</p>
<h1 class="western">LAMP Server Administration Project #1 - Install
and Configure Apache Web Server</h1>
<p>In order to install software, again, you'll need root access. To
install Apache in Debian based Distros, type:</p>
<pre class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in">sudo apt-get install apache2</pre><p>
This might take a while, but when it's done, you should be good to go
with apache. We'll have to do a little tweaking, but for the most
part it's already up and running. I'm going to do the rest of this
tutorial assuming you're running Mint or Ubuntu or another very
similar distro, so if you're running something else, be sure to check
your documentation (really, you should be doing this anyway no matter
what distro you're running). The first thing we can do is check to
see if the server is running. run:</p>
<pre class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in">ps -e | grep apache</pre><p>
to see if you have a process running already. If not, try to start it
with</p>
<pre class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in">sudo service apache2 start</pre><p>
When it's running, point your web browser to 127.0.0.1 and see what
happens. If everything went well you should see a simple page that
says &quot;it works!&quot;. This file is &quot;/var/www/index.html&quot;
by default. You can edit the file, or delete it and replace it with
whatever you want. Anything you have in the directory /var/www/
(called &quot;web root&quot;) will be accessible by typing your
computer's IP address into the address bar in a web browser - of
course unless you have changed your router's settings, it will only
work on your own LAN, and everything is subject to the file
permissions you set - if none of the files in the web root have read
permissions you'll get an error 403 in a browser.</p>
<p>If Apache is working, we'll need to make a few changes so that
things we will do in later tutorials will work. Feel free to skip
this and come back to it later if you run into an error condition or
something, and as always before you do anything you should consult
the documentation. The first thing we need to do is enable mod
rewrite</p>
<pre class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in">sudo a2enmod rewrite</pre><p>
You may also need to change the line &quot;AllowOverride None&quot;
to &quot;AllowOverride All&quot; under &quot;Directory /var/www/&quot;
in the file /etc/apache2/sites-available/default&quot; 
</p>
<h1 class="western">LAMP Server Administration Project #2 - Install
and configure Webmin</h1>
<p>Up until now we've spent a lot of time on the command line, but
sometimes it's nice to have a GUI. Webmin provides a sleek, intuitive
web interface for completing basic and advanced administration tasks.
If you think you'd rather do things in hard-core mode, feel free to
skip this project. You can get webmin at www.webmin.com. It's not in
the repositories for Ubuntu or Linux Mint AFAIK, but the webmin
development team has gone through the trouble of posting a .deb for
us, so we won't have to go too far out of the way to get this done.
Go ahead and download that deb, then cd to the directory it's in and
run</p>
<pre class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in">sudo dpkg -i webmin.version.whatever.deb</pre><p>
of course you're going to want to substitute the correct filename.
It'll go through an install process, and when it's done it'll spit
out some information about how to access the web interface. Usually
it's &quot;your-ip:10000&quot; or &quot;localhost:10000&quot; or
&quot;127.0.0.1:10000&quot; or something like that. You'll be
presented with a login screen - login and you'll be presented with an
information page that shows you a little bit about the maching you're
running. Be careful about what you do here - keep in mind, this is a
UI for system administration, so you shouldn't modify anything unless
you know what you're doing. Feel free to look around though, you
won't mess anything up unless you cange it first.</p>
<p>Click on &quot;Servers&quot; in the menu on the left. It should
expand to show that you're running Apache Webserver. Click on that to
see settings associated with your Apache install.</p>
<p>If you expand the system menu, then click &quot;scheduled cron
jobs&quot; you can see what's going on in cron. Also in the system
menu you can click &quot;running processes&quot; to see a list of
every process currently running. This is the same as typing &quot;ps
-e&quot; in a terminal window, but the output is much easier to look
through with this UI. Webmin is capable of doing most system
administration tasks, and you can consult the webmin docs for a full
list of what and how. A later project will involve running a squid
proxy, and having webmin installed will help out a lot.</p>
<h1 class="western">LAMP Server Administration Project #3 - Install
and Configure PHPMyAdmin</h1>
<p>The &quot;M&quot; in LAMP stands for MySQL, which is a database
program that runs as a server. If you plan on managing a lot of data:
by generating it, storing it, manipulating it, or whatever else; it
makes sense to use a database. I'm running Ubuntu server, which has
MySQL installed by default, but if you are using something else, you
may need to install it.</p>
<pre class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in">sudo apt-get install mysql-server</pre><p>
<br/>
<br/>

</p>
<h3 class="western">Installing PHPMyAdmin</h3>
<p>Managing MySQL takes a lot of knowledge because the syntax takes
some getting used to. Over the command line, it can be very difficult
for a beginner to wrap their head around what's actually happening
when you issue commands. That's why it can be helpful to have a Web
interface. Just like Webmin, PHPMyAdmin allows a system administrator
to make changes to the settings of an otherwise difficult to
understand CLI program via a GUI. To be clear: I think everyone
should learn to do things over the command line, but I also think
that starting out that way entirely can be prohibitively
intimidating. PHPMyAdmin can be installed with apt-get</p>
<pre class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in">sudo apt-get install phpmyadmin</pre><p>
In this project we're going to create a database to manage all the
data that will be generated with the bash script written in linux
project #4. Keep this in mind as we continue.</p>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<h3 class="western">Setting up a User and Database</h3>
<p>Once PHPMyAdmin is installed, you can get to the web interface by
pointing your browser to &quot;127.0.0.1/phpmyadmin&quot;, or
&quot;your-local-ip/phpmyadmin&quot;. Once you're in, we need to
create a new user to manage a database, as it's probably not best to
run everything as root. Click on &quot;privileges&quot; then &quot;add
a new user&quot;. Choose whatever username you want, but keep in
mind, later we'll be choosing an option that will simultaneously
create a database with the same name, so it makes more sense to
choose something that describes the database we'll create than it
does to pick something like &quot;joe&quot;. In other words, the user
you're creating here is not a user that you run phpmyadmin with, it's
the user that owns and maintains the database we need for this
project. I chose the user name &quot;opinionpage&quot;. Select
&quot;localhost&quot; as the host, and generate a random password. Be
sure to write down the password and save it somewhere safe. As far as
I know (and I've been in this situation before) you can't recover
this password, only reset it, so don't lose it. Make sure to check
&quot;create database with same name and grant all privileges&quot;,
then create the user.</p>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<h3 class="western">Setting up a Table</h3>
<p>Once you have a new database, we need to set up a table within it.
The table will hold data collected by our Bash script, and it won't
have to be very complicated. We will only need three columns to hold
the data - an auto-incrementing index, a date column, and a column to
hold all the URLs generated by the script each day. If we had to
visualize what this is going to look like, it would look something
like this:</p>
<pre class="western">     |-----------------------------------------------------------|
     |                opinionpage (our database)                 |
     |-----------------------------------------------------------|
     |       index      |         date         |       urls      |
     |------------------|----------------------|-----------------|
     |        01        |      2012-03-01      | [URLs from 3/1] |
     |------------------|----------------------|-----------------|
     |        02        |      2012-03-02      | [URLs from 3/2] |
     |------------------|----------------------|-----------------|
     |        03        |      2012-03-03      | [URLs from 3/3] |
     |------------------|----------------------|-----------------|
     |        04        |      2012-03-04      | [URLs from 3/4] |
     |------------------|----------------------|-----------------|
     |        05        |      2012-03-05      | [URLs from 3/5] |
     |------------------|----------------------|-----------------|
     |        06        |      2012-03-06      | [URLs from 3/6] |
     |------------------|----------------------|-----------------|
     |        07        |      2012-03-07      | [URLs from 3/7] |
     |-----------------------------------------------------------|


</pre><p>
Each column is a data category and each row is a new entry. It is all
contained within the database called &quot;opinionpage&quot;. here is
the data you'll need to set up each of those columns. If I don't
specify something, then just go with the default or leave it blank.</p>
<pre class="western">
<b>Column 1</b>
column: index
type: int
index: primary
auto increment: checked

<b>Column 2</b>
column: date
type: date

<b>Column 3</b>
column: urls
type:text
</pre><p>
Click &quot;save&quot; at the bottom. Our database and table is set
up and ready to go. There is still nothing in it, so we'll do that
with Python in the next project.</p>
<h1 class="western">LAMP Server Administration Project #4 - Python</h1>
<p>So far we have created a bash script that downloads an html page,
then grabs urls from it, formats them and saves them to a file. Then
we put that script in cron so it runs daily. Next we set up an apache
web server, installed some basic web UI tools, and set up a MySQL
database and table. If we're going to put those things to good use,
we need more. In this project we'll write a Python script (and put it
in cron) that adds the urls generated by our bash script to the table
in our database.</p>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<h3 class="western">Python</h3>
<p>Python is a great language with a very simple syntax. It's the
first language I ever tried to learn (though I later abandoned it
[temporarily] in favor of PHP). It's easier to understand by looking
at the code than some other languages, but it's still very powerful.
This script will use the MySQLdb module which you might have to
install</p>
<p>The first thing the script will need to do is get the date in the
appropriate format, then add it to a string containing a path to the
file generated by the bash script so we can point to the right file
depending on what day it is. 
</p>
<pre class="western">import datetime
today=str(datetime.date.today())
filename=&quot;/var/www/news/times-news/&quot;+today+&quot;.opinionurls.txt&quot;</pre><p>
You can't add strings and objects in python, and the date is an
object, so it needs to be treated like a string. That's what &quot;str()&quot;
is for. We then declare a variable called &quot;filename&quot; (which
is a string) that contains the location of the text file with the
urls in it. I put mine under web root in a folder hierarchy
&quot;news/times-news/&quot;. this means that to look at the file in
a web browser, I'd go to 
</p>
<pre class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in">&quot;http://127.0.0.1/news/times-news/2012-03-05.opinionurls.txt&quot;</pre><p>
The bash script from the previous project was designed to run as a
regular user, so it dropped the files in the home directory of the
user that ran it. If you want to drop the url-containing text files
in a folder on your web server, you'll have to modify the bash script
to reflect the change, and then run it as root (take it out of your
cron tab, and put it in root's cron tab).</p>
<p>Now that python knows where the file is, we'll open it</p>
<pre class="western">f = open(filename, 'r')
urls=str(f.read())</pre><p>
In the code above, we open the file whose location is stored as the
variable &quot;filename&quot; in read mode as the variable &quot;f&quot;.
We treat that like a string with the variable &quot;urls&quot;. Next
we need to connect to the database</p>
<pre class="western">import MySQLdb
conn = MySQLdb.connect(host=&quot;localhost&quot;,user=&quot;opinionpage&quot;,passwd=&quot;YOUR-PASSWORD-HERE&quot;,db=&quot;opinionpage&quot;)
cursor = conn.cursor()</pre><p>
The previous example imports the necessary module, connects to the
specified database with the supplied credentials and gets ready to
input data</p>
<pre class="western">cursor.execute(&quot;&quot;&quot;INSERT INTO opinionurls VALUES(NULL,CURDATE(),%s)&quot;&quot;&quot;, (urls))
conn.commit()</pre><p>
Notice the string substitution above. If you attempt to put a
variable directly into cursor.execute, it will either give you an
error or add the string of the variable name to the table depending
on if you use quotes or not.</p>
<p>We can put it all together into a script</p>
<pre class="western">#!/usr/bin/python

import MySQLdb
import datetime

#get the date, use it to create a variable with a link to our file
today=str(datetime.date.today())
filename=&quot;/var/www/news/times-news/&quot;+today+&quot;.opinionurls.txt&quot;

#open the file
f = open(filename, 'r')
urls=str(f.read())

#connect to the database
conn = MySQLdb.connect (host = &quot;localhost&quot;,user = &quot;opinionpage&quot;,passwd = &quot;YOUR-PASSWORD-HERE&quot;,db = &quot;opinionpage&quot;)
cursor = conn.cursor()

#add data from file to table
cursor.execute(&quot;&quot;&quot;INSERT INTO opinionurls VALUES(NULL,CURDATE(),%s)&quot;&quot;&quot;, (urls))
conn.commit()</pre><p>
Add this script to cron. It uses data from the bash script also in
cron, so it's important that the python script runs sometime after
the bash script is done. On my server the bash script only takes a
few seconds, so it's fine to add the bash script at 5:00AM and the
python script at 5:01AM. At this point we have a functional database
with new data added to a table on a daily basis, but we still can't
do anything with it. In the next section we'll make this data work
for us with PHP.</p>
<h1 class="western">LAMP Server Administration Project #5 - PHP</h1>
<p>PHP provides a quick and easy way of viewing the data we just
added to the table. All you have to do to run a PHP script is put a
file ending in .php on a webserver and navigate to it in a web
browser. Make sure PHP is installed before you continue. You can type
&quot;php --version&quot; in a terminal to see if it's there, and if
not, apt-get it. The script we'll create here will be relatively
simple. Keep in mind that this is just a starting point - If you want
to really make this shine, you'll have to add some html and css, and
even extend the use of php a little bit.</p>
<p>The first thing to do in our PHP script is declare a bunch of
variables which we'll use later to connect to the database.</p>
<pre class="western">&lt;?php

$username=&quot;opinionpage&quot;;
$password=&quot;YOUR-PASSWORD-HERE&quot;;
$database=&quot;opinionpage&quot;;
$date=date('Y-m-d');

?&gt;</pre><p>
Next we'll connect to the database</p>
<pre class="western">&lt;?php

mysql_connect('localhost',$username,$password)
    or die('Could not connect: ' . mysql_error());
mysql_select_db($database) or die('Could not select database');

?&gt;</pre><p>
The above is straight out of the PHP Manual so I'm not going to get
into it.</p>
<pre class="western">&lt;?php

$current=mysql_query('SELECT * FROM opinionpage WHERE date = &quot;'.$date.'&quot;');
$row = mysql_fetch_array($current);
$urlsarray = explode(&quot;\n&quot;, $row['urls']);

?&gt;</pre><p>
Let's break this down line by line. <br/>
Line 1: Create the variable
$current from the output of a mysql query (the part in parentheses).
The MySql query asks for everything (*) in the row from the
opinionpage table (opinionpage) where the date column (date) is the
same as the evaluated output of the variable $date, which is equal to
&quot;date('Y-m-d')&quot;, which prints the current date as
yyyy-mm-dd. In other words, it asks for the row of data created
today. <br/>
<br/>
Line 2: Create the variable $row which is an array
created from the row of data selected in the previous line. We'll be
able to manipulate this array as any other, but it is associative,
using the column names as keys. We can, for example, ask for the data
in the date column with $row['date'] or the index column with the
variable $row['index']. <br/>
<br/>
The last line of the above block
uses the $row array created in the second line. When we call
$row['urls'] we get the same thing as the entire text file created
with the bash script. Having the data presented in this way isn't
particularly useful, so we need to be able to grab distinct values
from it somehow. To solve this problem, we create a new array
$urlsarray by using explode to separate elements in $row['urls']
based on where a new line occurs, such that every individual line of
text originally in the text file we created with bash (which was then
moved into MySQL) will become a distinct value in the new array.
Because each url occupies its own line, we now have an array where
each url is a different value. We can call the first url with
$urlsarray[0] or the second with $urlsarray[1] and so on. If we
wanted to know how many elements are in the array, we could use
$count(), though because of the way we'll use this data, it doesn't
matter how many elements there are. We'll use a foreach loop, so
however many urls there are is how many times we'll work with them.</p>
<pre class="western">&lt;?php

foreach ($urlsarray as $url){
        
        $locs = str_replace(&quot;http://times-news.com/opinion&quot;, &quot;&quot;, $url);
        $pattern='#(.*)/x(.*?)/#is';
        $replacement=&quot;&quot;;
        $titled=preg_replace($pattern, $replacement, $locs);
        $title = str_replace(&quot;-&quot;, &quot; &quot;, $titled);
        echo &quot;&lt;a href='&quot;.$url.&quot;'&gt;&quot;.$title.&quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;;
        }

?&gt;</pre><p>
we then run a foreach loop, doing some string operations on each item
in the array (removing everything but the filename from the url, then
removing the dashes from between each word in the filename and
replacing them with spaces.) Then we take both the cleaned up
filename, and the raw url, and format them appropriately as a link in
the form: &quot;&lt;a href='url'&gt;title&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;.
This same operation is done on every url in the row. Again, let's
look at this line by line.</p>
<pre class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in">foreach ($urlsarray as $url){</pre><p>
foreach will go through the array $urlsarray and process each element
as its own variable: $url. everything that happens in the loop
happens once for each element. Instead of writing code that brings up
element 1, does something to it, saves it as a new variable and moves
on to element 2, foreach will automate that, making less work and way
less code.</p>
<pre class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in">$locs = str_replace(&quot;http://times-news.com/opinion&quot;, &quot;&quot;, $url);</pre><p>
This line looks for the text &quot;http://times-news.com/opinion&quot;
and then replaces it with nothing. If you wanted to, you could use
str_replace to substitute some other text, but we just want to get
rid of it, so after the comma we have quotes with nothing in them,
then the object we want to perform the operation on: in this case
$url, which is the current iteration in the for each loop.</p>
<pre class="western">$pattern='#(.*)/x(.*?)/#is';
$replacement=&quot;&quot;;
$titled=preg_replace($pattern, $replacement, $locs);</pre><p>
$pattern establishes a regular expression that will be used by
preg_replace. $replacement is what the text that matches the regular
expression will be replaced with, in this case nothing. Finally we
put that into preg_replace. 
</p>
<pre class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in">$title = str_replace(&quot;-&quot;, &quot; &quot;, $titled);</pre><p>
The $title variable takes everything that was done before (which has
left us with something like: &quot;this-is-the-letter-title&quot;)
and removes the dashes and replaces them with spaces.</p>
<pre class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in">echo &quot;&lt;a href='&quot;.$url.&quot;'&gt;&quot;.$title.&quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;;</pre><p>
finally we echo both the full url as well as the cleaned up title
within html link tags so that we have a link to the letter in
question with the correct title. Because of the foreach loop this is
done on every url in the array.</p>
<p>All that's left is to package this up in a nice .php file, throw
it on the webserver, and we're done.</p>
<pre class="western">&lt;html&gt;

Every day when you look at that same page, it will change
automatically to display a list of links that reflects the current
letters to the editor as posted on the Cumberland Times-News webpage.
This setup leaves open the possibility of looking at links for
previous day's letters as well, all you'd have to do is add an html
form that specifies the date and uses that user input instead of the
current date. Since the urls are being added to a database
automatically each day, the data is always there at your disposal.
It's up to you to figure out what you want to do with it.</p>

<h3 class="western">Network Project #1 - Installing Custom Router
Firmware</h3>
<p>You probably have a router connected to your modem that you use to
share your internet connection with multiple computers. Most
store-bought routers are capable of a lot more than they deliver -
many companies build several versions of their firmware that they put
on more or less identical hardware, only to sell the more &quot;advanced&quot;
models for far more money. We've learned about the importance of
running free software in the Linux project section, but now we'll
discover that we can run the firmware of our choice on many routers,
vastly increasing the functionality while at the same time spending
no money.</p>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<h3 class="western">Network Project #2 - Re-purpose Old webcams as
Live-Streaming Security Cameras</h3>
<p>If you're like me, you've got a box of old hardware sitting around
somewhere. I can't bring myself to throw out old keyboards, cables,
webcams, or whatever else, so I've got a spare parts box in my
basement that I make frequent use of when completing new projects.
One way to easily use some of that old hardware is to attach an old
webcam to a network connected computer, and stream the output over
your LAN. I have a webcam mounted just outside of my office window
pointed at my front door. When someone comes to the door, I can check
to see who it is before going to answer it. This is Tony Montana
level security for almost no cost.</p>
<p><br/>

<h3 class="western">Network Project #3 - Use Squid Proxy to Filter
Out Unwanted Content from your Network</h3>
<p>If you've been paying close attention to the way the Internet has
been changing recently, you may have found yourself upset over the
extent to which targeted ads and behavior tracking have invaded
seemingly innocuous content. Nearly every page you visit has a
facebook like button, and believe it or not, the like button exists
(at least in part) as a method of tracking you across the internet.
Hundreds of companies have suddenly cropped up to serve the rapidly
expanding market of targeted advertising. If you are interested, you
can see who is tracking you by installing a firefox addon called
Collusion. I don't care if it's for advertising or any other reason,
I don't want to be tracked, so I run all of my internet traffic
through a filter that removes known trackers, servers that host
nothing but ads, phishing sites, and other undesireable web content.
This project will explain how to install and configure Squid web
proxy.</p>
<h1 class="western">Network Project #1 - Installing Custom Router
Firmware</h1>
<p>You probably didn't know that you could swap out the firmware on
your router to unlock its true potential. I'm sure the router
manufacturers like it that way - you'll have to spend more to get
more functionality. Of course it doesn't have to be that way.</p>
<h3 class="western">On Hacking</h3>
<p>Hardware is hardware, and if you own it, you should have the right
to make it do whatever you want. This is what hacking is all about.
We've seen this recently with the spread of smart phones that are
essentially locked down into a state of reduced functionality,
forcing users to install only proprietary software distributed only
through channels approved by the manufacturer (and subject to it's
censorship). Needless to say, this is not the best model for free use
of software, or for free speech, or even for accomplishing every day
tasks with the technology in question. What it is, is a business
model - and it has worked well for those on top. I'd like to use my
hardware to accomplish my own goals rather than for the benefit of
whoever is selling it. When I see that something I own has more
potential - I'll modify it so that it lives up to that potential.
When most people hear the word &quot;hacking&quot; they think of
identity thieves and people who write viruses, but I (and many
others) think that hacking means taking control of your own hardware
(or more broadly - of your own life) by asking questions about how
things work, by making changes to things that you think aren't
working the way you want them to</p>
<h3 class="western">Hacking your Router with Custom Firmware</h3>
<p>There are several current projects offering custom firmware for
routers: dd-wrt, Tomato, and OpenWrt. You'll want to look at each
page to see what hardware is supported by each project, then choose a
project based on the features you're looking for. Because the range
of hardware available is so wide, and the versions of the custom
firmware varies so much, I'm not going to spend time with a
walkthrough on how to install this firmware on any particular type of
hardware (especially since it's already been done by each of these
projects themselves), but I would like to give you a sense of the
benefits of installing custom firmware.</p>
<p>The first reason is that when you're running free or open source
firmware, you have control over it. When it comes to routing, you
want as much control as you can get. I recently had the opportunity
to look at the Actiontec GT701C and I was shocked to find that not
only does the default firmware log <i>every</i> website any networked
computer looks at, but it also provides the owner of the hardware
with no method of deleting the log, or stopping it from tracking your
activity. Why would anyone want that? Well, I can think of some
reasons why some people might want it, but not the end users - this
heavy handed method of taking control from the owner of the hardware
does not benefit the consumer, it benefits the manufacturer, and
possibly the ISP or the government, who both maintain logs on
internet activity and may have an interest in decentralized logging
as a backup to the ones they already keep. If you're running this
hardware and would like to learn how to disable the logs, check out
this blog post</p>
<p>Another reason you may want to run custom router firmware is the
fine grain control over your routing that it provides. Most of these
projects allow users to directly enter iptables rules, but they also
provide a user interface for configuring things more easily. One
example of something that you can do is create a vlan, then write
rules to keep that vlan completely separate from the rest of your
network, so you could have a wireless connection for your family that
gives access to local resources, and one for guests that only allows
access to the internet. This kind of control is worth having if you
frequently get into technology related projects.</p>
<h1 class="western">Network Project #2 - Re-purpose Old webcams as
Live-Streaming Security Cameras</h1>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p>This project will use mjpgstreamer and zone minder in conjunction
with an existing webserver in order to stream output of webcams to a
local webpage.</p>
<p>The first step is to get mjpgstreamer</p>
<pre class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in">wget http://sourceforge.net/projects/mjpg-streamer/files/mjpg-streamer_r94-1_i386.deb</pre><p>
because this is an older project, and the debian rules for version
numbers are being enforced differently, you can't just install that
package with &quot;dpkg -i&quot; - you'll have to repackage it first.
Debian used to allow alphanumeric version numbers like this package
contains, but now if you try to install it, you'll get an error, so
we have to change the version number before installing the package.
Extract the filesystem tree to a directory &quot;packagename.x.x.x&quot;:</p>
<pre class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in">dpkg-deb -x packagename.x.x.x.deb packagename.x.x.x</pre><p>
Extract the control file information and cd into the directory:</p>
<pre class="western">dpkg-deb -e packagename.x.x.x.deb packagename.x.x.x/DEBIAN
cd packagename.x.x.x/DEBIAN</pre><p>
Edit the file called &quot;control&quot; and change the desired
version number for the dependency that you want to change. Once
that's done, rebuild the deb package:</p>
<pre class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in">dpkg-deb -b packagename.x.x.x packagename.x.x.x.deb</pre><p>
now use &quot;dpkg -i&quot; to install the modified package. When
it's installed you can start your camera with mjpg streamer. You'll
need to know where in /dev/ your camera is. It's probably /dev/video0
or /dev/video1, but you should unplug the camera, plug it back in,
then run dmesg to see where it gets assigned so you know for sure.
You can start your camera stream by running something like the
following:</p>
<pre class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in">sudo mjpg_streamer -i &quot;input_uvc.so -d /dev/video0/&quot; -o &quot;output_http.so -w /var/www -p 8099&quot;</pre><p>
Where /dev/video0/ is changed to the appropriate address for your
camera, and -p 8099 is set to whatever port you want to stream to.
Now navigate your browser to &quot;http://127.0.0.1:8099/?action=stream&quot;
to see the raw video stream.</p>
<p>If you want to take this to the next level, install Zone Minder
and add your network stream as a camera in Zone Minder.</p>
<h1 class="western">Network Project #3 - Use Squid Proxy to Filter
Out Unwanted Content from your Network</h1>
<p>Squid is a caching proxy which can be used to speed up your
browsing, or filter out sites, IPs, or even certain types of content
based on rules called access control lists (ACLs). Start by
apt-getting squid. We'll have to edit the configuration file, but
before we do, we should back it up. The conf file is
&quot;/etc/squid/squid.conf&quot;</p>
<pre class="western">Sudo cp /etc/squid/squid.conf /etc/squid/squid.conf.bak
sudo gedit /etc/squid/squid.conf</pre><p>
By default all traffic is denied (&quot;http_access deny all&quot;).edit
the file to add your local network by adding these lines</p>
<pre class="western">acl intranet 192.168.1.0/24
http_access allow intranet</pre><p>
Make sure that the line &quot;http_access allow intranet&quot; is
above the line that says &quot;http_access deny all&quot;. You can
change the port that squid runs on by changing &quot;http_port&quot;
but it isn't necessary. The default is 3128.</p>
<p>When you start squid for the first time, you need to create the
swap directories. Do that with the -z argument.</p>
<pre class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in">sudo squid -z</pre><p>
When that's done, start squid normally</p>
<pre class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in">sudo service squid start</pre><p>
To configure your browser to use squid, you'll need to change its
network settings. In firefox that's in preferences -&gt; Network -&gt;
settings. Change http, https, and ftp proxy to the ip address of your
squid server on port 3128. If you make this change in your browser,
and everything still works - you're using squid successfully.</p>
<p>The next step is to create some ACLs to filter unwanted websites
from our network. Run</p>
<pre class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in">sudo nano /etc/squid/block.acl</pre><p>
to open a text editor to create a file that will contain a list of
blocked sites. Enter into this file the following:</p>
<pre class="western">.facebook.com
.facebook.net
.fbcdn.net</pre><p>
Save the file, then open squid.conf again. In the acl section add the
following</p>
<pre class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in">acl blocksites dstdom_regex &quot;/etc/squid/block.acl&quot;</pre><p>
Now scroll down in the squid.conf file, and above &quot;http_access
allow intranet&quot; at the very top of the list of &quot;http_access&quot;
rules, add the following line:</p>
<pre class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in">http_access deny blocksites</pre><p>
Every site in the list &quot;/etc/squid/block.acl&quot; will be
blocked after restarting squid</p>
<pre class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in">sudo service squid restart</pre><p>
open the browser you configured to work with squid previously and try
to open www.facebook.com. You should see a page saying that access is
denied. There are lots of rules available in squid - you can block
certain sites for certain computers at certain times of the day. You
could redirect traffic from one site to another, you can stop users
from looking at videos, or hundreds of other types of things. Take a
look at the squid docs to learn more about it. If you installed
webmin in LAMP Server Administration Project #2 then you can use
webmin to manage squid. You don't have to open squid.conf if it's
intimidating - go ahead and create your ACL's with webmin instead (to
be clear, you should still learn to do it via the .conf file). To
look at squid in webmin, select &quot;Servers&quot; from the left
menu, then click &quot;squid&quot;. If it isn't there you should be
able to find it by searching for &quot;squid&quot; in the search box.
